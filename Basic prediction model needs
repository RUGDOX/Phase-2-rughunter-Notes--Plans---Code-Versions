Overview of the Approach
Data Collection:

Blockchain Data: Collect transaction data, token liquidity, developer activity, and more from various blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain).
Social Data: Gather data from social media platforms, forums, and news outlets for sentiment analysis.
Project Metadata: Collect information on team members, project whitepapers, tokenomics, etc.
Feature Engineering:

On-Chain Metrics: Volume of transactions, liquidity changes, wallet activity of developers, token distribution, and smart contract interactions.
Off-Chain Metrics: Social media sentiment, GitHub activity, and team credibility.
Model Development:

Supervised Learning: Use labeled data to train the model to distinguish between rug pulls and legitimate projects.
Anomaly Detection: Implement unsupervised techniques to detect unusual patterns in
